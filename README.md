# News Aggregator

## Description
A mini search engine that aggregates news articles by crawling RSS and HTML documents using Jsoup. The app creates an indexer to classify the articles into relevant terms, and when users enter a term, it retrieves articles related to this term. A trie data structure was implemented for the search-autocomplete feature, and the GUI was implemented with Java SWING.
